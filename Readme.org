#+TITLE: Learning Spring with Spring Boot

* About
I followed the tutorial in the Lynda course "Learning Spring with Spring Boot". 

* Initialization
- Use the initializer to create a Spring project: [[https://start.spring.io/]] 
- Switch to the full version in the initializer, select the following dependencies:
  - Web / Web
  - Template Engines / Thymeleaf
  - SQL / JPA, H2
  - Ops / Actuator
- Download the generated project and open in IntelliJ

** Play with Actuator 
Actuator allows you to monitor and manage the application. 
- In file =application.properties=, add line ~management.security.enabled=false~
- Run =com.example.DemoApplication.main()=, then the server is up. 
- Visit ~http://localhost:8080/env~ to access environment information.
